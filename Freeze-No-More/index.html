</td><td><p>If you have an underperforming PC that freezes more often than not, 
this program will help prevent a lock up and help reduce the length of an 
already active one. This program automatically ends any other 
running tasks that are not responding, hencefourth reducing the likelyhood of 
a lock up. This program also uses very little memory (about 4KB) 
and little compuer power, so it won't slow your computer down.</p><p>
